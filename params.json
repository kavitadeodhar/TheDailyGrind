There are many options and people tend to be loyal to their brands. The intent is to explore which brand do people favor based on their tweets. We would like to show how data could provide highly useful insights about the business. This should serve as a source of information and should provide valuable insights. By harnessing the power of data companies can provide better service to the customers. This could be used for better customer service, improving marketing strategy. It could also be used to see how a company could expand their presence. We will also try to see if a region favors one brand over the other. Also the intent is to explore whether momentary emotion conveyed via a tweet has any correlation on customer satisfaction index. We will compare CSAT data from ACSI(American customer satisfaction index) to the scores generated using our code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Objectives\r\n\r\nThrough this project we would like to learn and accomplish following objectives:\r\n* Perform sentiment analysis on twitter data for various quick service restaurant brands and determine which brand is most favored.\r\n* Does brand preference change in different parts of the country?\r\n* Perform regression analysis and determine if emotion expressed on twitter ties into/affects/compares to customer satisfaction index calculated using multivariate customer experience data.\r\n* We would like to see if there is a trend (plot against time).\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nWe began our study by collecting data from following sources:\r\n* Tweets with hash tags of various quick service restaurants were collected using the twitterR package.\r\n* ACSI data from ACSI website for following Quick Serve Restaurants like Dunkin, Starbucks, McDonalds, Panera and Subway.\r\n* Emoticons conversion file\r\nWe then performed the data scraping tasks. The tweets collected had emoticons. To get the right sentiment from these emojis we had to convert these emojis to correct text. The data was cleansed so that each tweet could impart the correct sentiment. Once the data was cleansed we performed a series of exploratory data analysis to understand the general sentiment of a quick service restaurant. This analysis revealed a lot of facts about how a company is perceived by a customer. \r\n\r\n##Sentiment Analysis\r\n\r\n###Plotting data on US map\r\nAs the first part of our analysis,we are going to map all the tweets based on the geo code on US map. This is an attempt to see which brand is popular in which region. \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/USmap.PNG) \r\nFrom the map above,we can see the distribution of tweets across the country. We see that the number of tweets for Panera look higher. The number of tweets for every brand was the same.This simply means that the latitude longitude information was available for larger number of tweets for Panera than the other brands.\r\n\r\nNext we proceed with cleaning the data before calculating the score for every tweet.This includes removing special characters, punctuations, words like https, https.  \r\n###Calculating tweet scores for all brands.\r\nWe will use the nrc sentiment categories.The get_nrc_sentiment implements Saif Mohammad’s NRC Emotion lexicon. According to Mohammad, “the NRC emotion lexicon is a list of words and their associations with eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive)” (See http://www.purl.org/net/NRCemotionlexicon). The get_nrc_sentiment function returns a data frame in which each row represents a sentence from the original file. Source of the above information is “https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html”\r\n###Sentiment per brand\r\nBelow is the plot of number of tweets per brand per category.It helps is understand the general emotion for each brand and also per category for every brand.\r\n![Sumit](images/Sentiment.PNG) \r\n\r\nThe categories of sentiments are fine, but what are those words that people associate with these brands? What is it that people are talking about in regards to the brands?\r\n\r\nWord cloud helps us do just that. Below are the word clouds for all the 5 of our brands. Note that the font is largest for the most popular word and decreases as the frequency decreases. \r\nThe most used words will change through out the course of the day as more tweets are added from the new day and old ones removed. \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/DD_wordmap.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/SB_wordmap.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/MCD_wordmap.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/PB_wordmap.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/subway_wordmap.PNG) \r\n\r\n###Sentiment Over Time\r\nWe have been able to gather tweets only for a ceratin number of days due to restrictions on the Twitter API. So we cannot see the trend of sentiment over years or months. However we will calculate and plot negative and positive sentiment over the last few days for all the brands.\r\n![Sumit](images/DD_sentiment.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/sb_sentiment.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/mcd_sentiment.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/panera_sentiment.PNG) \r\n\r\n![Sumit](images/subway_sentiment.PNG) \r\n###Comparing the distribution of scores.\r\nNext step would be to check the distribution of scores or sentiments. The difference between the positive and negative scores will give the general tweet sentiment or score. negative value will indicate negative sentiment and positive value will contain positive sentiment. \r\n\r\n![Sumit1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavitadeodhar/TheDailyGrind/gh-pages/images/DD_sentiment_score.png)  \r\n\r\n![Sumit2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavitadeodhar/TheDailyGrind/gh-pages/images/SB_sentiment_score.png)  \r\n\r\n![Sumit3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavitadeodhar/TheDailyGrind/gh-pages/images/MCD_sentiment_score.png)  \r\n\r\n![Sumit4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavitadeodhar/TheDailyGrind/gh-pages/images/Panera_sentiment_score.png)   \r\n\r\n![Sumit5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavitadeodhar/TheDailyGrind/gh-pages/images/Subway_sentiment_score.png)  \r\n\r\nThe customer satisfaction (ACSI) index score is calculated as a weighted average of three survey questions that measure different facets of satisfaction with a product or service. ACSI researchers use proprietary software technology to estimate the weighting for each question.Source of this information is “http://www.theacsi.org”\r\nThe last step is to compare the average tweet score(calculated for tweets in our dataset which are over a period of few days only) for all our brands with the ACSI index score which is determined as described above.\r\nAs can be seen from the table with average tweet scores calculated by us and ACSI index determined through surveys and research are close. There is a good possibility that the tweet scores could be used to predict the satisfaction index. \r\n\r\n![Sumit6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavitadeodhar/TheDailyGrind/gh-pages/images/Regression.png)   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Daily Grind For CSCIE-107 maintained by kavitadeodhar/sumitgupta\r\nPublished with GitHub Pages",
